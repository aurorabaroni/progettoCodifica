         For the most wild, yet most homely narrative which I am about to
         pen, I neither expect nor solicit belief. Mad indeed would I be
         to expect it, in a case where my very senses reject their own
         evidence. Yet, mad am I not—and very surely do I not dream. But
         to-morrow I die, and to-day I would unburthen my soul. My
         immediate purpose is to place before the world, plainly,
         succinctly, and without comment, a series of mere household
         events. In their consequences, these events have terrified—have
         tortured—have destroyed me. Yet I will not attempt to expound
         them. To me, they have presented little but horror—to many they
         will seem less terrible than barroques. Hereafter, perhaps,
         some intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the
         common-place—some intellect more calm, more logical, and far less
         excitable than my own, which will perceive, in the circumstances
         I detail with awe, nothing more than an ordinary succession of
         very natural causes and effects.

         From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my
         disposition. My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to
         make me the jest of my companions. I was especially fond of
         animals, and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of
         pets. With these I spent most of my time, and never was so happy
         as when feeding and caressing them. This peculiarity of character
         grew with my growth, and in my manhood, I derived from it one of
         my principal sources of pleasure. To those who have cherished an
         affection for a faithful and sagacious dog, I need hardly be at
         the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of the
         gratification thus derivable. There is something in the unselfish
         and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the
         heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry
         friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man.
