                        For the most wild, yet most homely narrative which I am about to
                        pen, I neither expect nor solicit belief. Mad indeed would I be
                        to expect it, in a case where my very senses reject their own
                        evidence. Yet, mad am I not—and very surely do I not dream. But
                        to-morrow I die, and to-day I would unburthen my soul. My
                        immediate purpose is to place before the world, plainly,
                        succinctly, and without comment, a series of mere household
                        events. In their consequences, these events have terrified—have
                        tortured—have destroyed me. Yet I will not attempt to expound
                        them. To me, they have presented little but horror—to many they
                        will seem less terrible than <hi rend="italic">barroques</hi>. Hereafter, perhaps,
                        some intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the
                        common-place—some intellect more calm, more logical, and far less
                        excitable than my own, which will perceive, in the circumstances
                        I detail with awe, nothing more than an ordinary succession of
                        very natural causes and effects.

                        From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my
                        disposition. My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to
                        make me the jest of my companions. I was especially fond of
                        animals, and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of
                        pets. With these I spent most of my time, and never was so happy
                        as when feeding and caressing them. This peculiarity of character
                        grew with my growth, and in my manhood, I derived from it one of
                        my principal sources of pleasure. To those who have cherished an
                        affection for a faithful and sagacious dog, I need hardly be at
                        the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of the
                        gratification thus derivable. There is something in the unselfish
                        and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the
                        heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry
                        friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere <hi rend="italic">Man</hi>.
