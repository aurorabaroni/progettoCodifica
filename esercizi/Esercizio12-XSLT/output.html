         <h4>Capitolo 1</h4>
         Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on
         the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had
         peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no
         pictures or conversations in it, and where is the use of a book,
         thought Alice, without pictures or conversations? So she was
         considering in her own mind, (as well as she could, for the hot
         day made her feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether the pleasure
         of making a daisy-chain was worth the trouble of getting up and
         picking the daisies, when a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close
         by her.<br> <br>
         
         There was nothing very remarkable in that, nor did Alice think it
         so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself
         "dear, dear! I shall be too late!" (when she thought it over
         afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at
         this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the
         rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, looked
         at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it
         flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit
         with either a waistcoat-pocket or a watch to take out of it, and,
         full of curiosity, she hurried across the field after it, and was
         just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the
         hedge. In a moment down went Alice after it, never once
         considering how in the world she was to get out again.<br> <br>
         
         The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and
         then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly, that Alice had not a
         moment to think about stopping herself, before she found herself
         falling down what seemed a deep well. Either the well was very
         deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she
         went down to look about her, and to wonder what would happen
         next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was
         coming to, but it was too dark to see anything: then, she looked
         at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
         cupboards and book-shelves: here and there were maps and pictures
         hung on pegs. She took a jar down off one of the shelves as she
         passed: it was labelled "Orange Marmalade," but to her great
         disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar,
         for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it
         into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.<br> <br>
         
         "Well!" thought Alice to herself, "after such a fall as this, I
         shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll
         all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even
         if I fell off the top of the house!" (which was most likely
         true.)<br> <br>
         
         Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? "I wonder
         how many miles I've fallen by this time?" she said aloud, "I must
         be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see:
         that would be four thousand miles down, I think--" (for you see
         Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in
         the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity
         of showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to hear her,
         still it was good practice to say it over,) "yes that's the right
         distance, but then what Longitude or Latitude-line shall I be
         in?" (Alice had no idea what Longitude was, or Latitude either,
         but she thought they were nice grand words to say.)<br> <br>
         
         Presently she began again: "I wonder if I shall fall right
         through the earth! How funny it'll be to come out among the
         people that walk with their heads downwards! But I shall have to
         ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please,
         Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?"--and she tried to
         curtsey as she spoke (fancy curtseying as you're falling through
         the air! do you think you could manage it?) "and what an ignorant
         little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to
         ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere."<br> <br>
         
         Down, down, down: there was nothing else to do, so Alice soon
         began talking again. "Dinah will miss me very much tonight, I
         should think!" (Dinah was the cat.) "I hope they'll remember her
         saucer of milk at tea-time! Oh, dear Dinah, I wish I had you
         here! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might
         catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know, my dear. But
         do cats eat bats, I wonder?" And here Alice began to get rather
         sleepy, and kept on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way
         "do cats eat bats? do cats eat bats?" and sometimes, "do bats
         eat cats?" for, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't
         much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing
         off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in
         hand with Dinah, and was saying to her very earnestly, "Now,
         Dinah, my dear, tell me the truth. Did you ever eat a bat?" when
         suddenly, bump! bump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and
         shavings, and the fall was over.<br> <br>
         
         
         
         
         
         <h4>Capitolo 2</h4>
         They were indeed a curious looking party that assembled on the
         bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their
         fur clinging close to them--all dripping wet, cross, and
         uncomfortable. The first question of course was, how to get dry:
         they had a consultation about this, and Alice hardly felt at all
         surprised at finding herself talking familiarly with the birds,
         as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a
         long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would
         only say "I am older than you, and must know best," and this
         Alice would not admit without knowing how old the Lory was, and
         as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was nothing
         more to be said.<br> <br>
         
         At last the mouse, who seemed to have some authority among them,
         called out "sit down, all of you, and attend to me! I'll soon
         make you dry enough!" They all sat down at once, shivering, in a
         large ring, Alice in the middle, with her eyes anxiously fixed on
         the mouse, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she
         did not get dry very soon.<br> <br>
         
         "Ahem!" said the mouse, with a self-important air, "are you all
         ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you
         please!<br> <br>
         
         "William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was
         soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had
         been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin
         and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--"<br> <br>
         
         "Ugh!" said the Lory with a shiver.<br> <br>
         
          [...] <br> <br>
         
         "In that case," said the Dodo solemnly, rising to his feet, "I
         move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more
         energetic remedies--"<br> <br>
         
         "Speak English!" said the Duck, "I don't know the meaning of half
         those long words, and what's more, I don't believe you do
         either!" And the Duck quacked a comfortable laugh to itself. Some
         of the other birds tittered audibly.<br> <br>
         
         "I only meant to say," said the Dodo in a rather offended tone,
         "that I know of a house near here, where we could get the young
         lady and the rest of the party dried, and then we could listen
         comfortably to the story which I think you were good enough to
         promise to tell us," bowing gravely to the mouse.<br> <br>
         
         The mouse made no objection to this, and the whole party moved
         along the river bank, (for the pool had by this time began to
         flow out of the hall, and the edge of it was fringed with rushes
         and forget-me-nots,) in a slow procession, the Dodo leading the
         way. After a time the Dodo became impatient, and, leaving the
         Duck to bring up the rest of the party, moved on at a quicker
         pace with Alice, the Lory, and the Eaglet, and soon brought them
         to a little cottage, and there they sat snugly by the fire,
         wrapped up in blankets, until the rest of the party had arrived,
         and they were all dry again.<br> <br>
         
         Then they all sat down again in a large ring on the bank, and
         begged the mouse to begin his story.<br> <br>
